# HTML `<portal>` Demo

## Description
This demo showcases Chrome's experimental `<portal>` element which functions very similarly to an `<iframe>`, but with the added ability to click directly into the portal source page. The goal of Chrome's portal project is to enhance prerendering with a inset preview of the content. At the time of this demo, `<portal>` is in the [draft](https://wicg.github.io/portals/) development stage.

This demo shows a simple list of webcomics. Each comic has a preview hero image and upon mousing over the section, a portal of the the webcomic page will load and display inline. A user can then click the portal to be taken immediately to the new page with it already preloaded.

## Prerequisites
You must be using Chrome and have the following flags enabled at `about://flags/#enable-portals`:
- ðŸš© Enable Portals
- ðŸš© Enable cross-origin Portals

Chrome will prompt you to relaunch your Browser and after doing so, you should see the `HTMLPortalElement` function available in your console:

## Setup
The easiest way to preview this demo is to use VSCode's [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension where you can start a local server to serve the `index.html` and `style.css` files. Note that `<portal>` will NOT work if viewing the page without a server, otherwise you will see the following warning in the console: `<portal> use is restricted to the HTTP family.`
